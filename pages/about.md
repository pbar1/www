## Me

I'm Pierce, a software engineer currently living in the San Francisco Bay Area. I work at [Meta][1], where I primarily develop remote execution and security tooling to protect the fleet. Before that I've worked at [Salesforce][2] on cloud architecture, containerization, and the other myriad hats of infrastructure. Even before that I was a consultant at [Clear Measure][3] building custom software in .NET and helping enterprises migrate to the cloud.

I'm relatively active on GitHub building various projects that pique my interest, mainly in [Rust][6] and [Nix][7] these days. A constant source of distraction is my homelab, which may more accurately be called my bonsai tree. I've also worked extensively in Go, and to a milder degree TypeScript, Python, and C#. Technical interests of mine hinge on most things Unix, cloud, and network security. Open source contributions I've made include maintaining a few Nix packages and adding some [Kubernetes][9] features to [HashiCorp Vault][8].

I'm originally from Houston, and before moving to the Bay I've also lived in Indiana for school and Austin for work. Texas holds a special place in my heart of course; they just don't smoke meat anywhere else like they do there. ðŸ¤ 

Officially I'm a chemical engineer. However, I wouldn't trust myself to engineer a chemical plant in any serious capacity nowadays. My undergraduate was earned at [Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology][4] where I also got a minor in German.

Outside of the virtual world, I'm also a former competitive swimmer since before I can even remember. I continued this all the way though my time at Rose, though have tapered off since then. Fun fact: I've [escaped from Alcatraz][5]. Aside from swimming, I'm also an avid national park seeker hoping to complete the quest of visiting all 63. I've been getting into traveling as well more recently.

I've maintained a fascination with the world of physics over the years. Despite having no formal training on the subject, I'm marveled by the underpinnings of the universe.
