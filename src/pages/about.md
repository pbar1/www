## Me

Hello friend! I'm Pierce, a software engineer currently living in the San Francisco Bay Area. I work at [Meta][1], where I primarily develop remote execution and security tooling to protect the fleet. Before that I've worked at [Salesforce][2] on cloud architecture, containerization, and the other myriad hats of infrastructure. Even before that I was a consultant at [Clear Measure][3] building custom software in .NET and helping enterprises migrate to the cloud.

I'm relatively active on GitHub building various projects that pique my interest, mainly in [Rust][6] and [Nix][7] these days. A constant source of distraction is my homelab, which may more accurately be called my bonsai tree. I've also worked extensively in Go, and to a lesser degree TypeScript, Python, and C#. Technical interests of mine hinge on most things Unix, cloud, and network security. Open source contributions I've made include maintaining a few Nix packages and adding some [Kubernetes][9] features to [HashiCorp Vault][8].

I'm originally from Houston, and before moving to the Bay Area I've also lived in Indiana for school and Austin for work. Texas holds a special place in my heart of course; they just don't smoke meat anywhere else like they do there. ðŸ¤ 

Officially I'm a chemical engineer. However, I wouldn't trust myself to engineer a chemical plant in any serious capacity nowadays. My undergraduate was earned at [Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology][4] where I also got a minor in German.

Outside of the virtual world, I'm also a former competitive swimmer since before I can even remember. I continued this all the way though my time at Rose, though have tapered off since then. Fun fact: I've [escaped from Alcatraz][5]. Aside from swimming, I'm also an avid national park seeker hoping to complete the quest of visiting all 63. I've been getting into traveling as well more recently.

I've maintained a fascination with the world of physics over the years. Despite having no formal training on the subject, I'm marveled by the underpinnings of the universe.

## This site

Here's the gist:

- Open source on GitHub at [pbar1/www][10]
- Static site built with [Astro][11]
  - Based on the theme [AstroPaper][12] ðŸ§¡
- Deployed with [GitHub Actions][13]
- Hosted on [GitHub Pages][14]

Posts are all written in Markdown. Previously I'd built this site with Hugo and hosted on GitLab Pages and Netlify, but nowadays I've settled on the extensibility of Astro due to its JavaScript integration and the simple shippability of the GitHub stack for CI/CD.
